# Using LangChain

This project will show you how to use the LangChain library to create a simple language chain to query a model and return a result.

## Setup a new environment

We will create an invironment using `conda` and then install the dependencies so that we don't have dependencies from this project polluting other projects.

```bash
$ conda create -n langchain python=3.11
$ conda activate langchain
```

## Install the dependencies
The dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed using `pip`:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Review the script and execute it

Open `main.py` in your favorite editor and review the code.

Run `main.py` with:

```bash
$ python main.py
```
